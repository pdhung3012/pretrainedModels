37,CLUBS,<p>Querido principal de la escuela^</p><p>Creando clubs crea una oportunidad magnifica para todos los estudiantes. Yo estuve pensando de una idea perfecta sera creando un club de verde en que consiste en reducir^ reutilizar^ reciclar. Este club podría ser enfocado en ayudando nuestro medio ambiente porqué es peligroso para el ambiente si nosotros no lo cuidamos. En este club^ los estudiantes pueden crear consciencia y ser mas familiar con los problemas alrededor del mundo sobre el peligro de no cuidando nuestro planeta. Tambíen^ este club tendrá un impacto positivo en la escuela porqué actividades sería implementado y contribue beneficios para el ambiente. Actividades que pueden ser implementado incluye plantar afuera en el patio de la escuela^ reutilizar cosas como vidrio^ papel^ latas^ bolsas de plástico^ y la lista continua. Además^ podemos poner papeles en las paredes para alertar los estudiantes si tengan ropa que no usen en la casa^ para traerlo y podemos reutilizar o  para donar. Addicionalmente^ queremos recuadar dinero para donar a las caridades de buen causas. Ojalá podriamos ser un buen ejemplo para otras escuelas y ellos pueden siguir en nuestro direción. En el final^ la meta es para beneficar el ambiente^ educar nuestros estudiantes sobre peligros de falta de cuidado a nuestra planeta^ y crear consciencia en general para este mundo sera un mejor lugar.

Otra fórma en qúe los jovenes se comunican es atraves de las redes sociales. Es mas facil hoy en dia charlar com las redes sociales.

93,COMMUNICATIONS,<p>Es obvio la manera de comunicar entre los adultos y adolescentes es diferente. Donde yo vivo^ la actitud y manierismos es diferente. Yo pienso que en los adolescentes^ la forma de comunicar es menos serio de los adultos. Tambíen ellos usan el telefono via diferentes apps para comunicarse entre otros. Hay applicaiones como SnapChat^ iMessage^ Instagram^ Facebook^ WhatsApp^ y posible mas. Usualmente buscas los adolescentes usando snapchat mucho para chatear con sus amigos. En los adultos mas mayor es común para buscarles usando applicaiones como Facebook y WhatsApp. Cuando los adolescentes comunican^ ellos usen frases acrónimos como |lol| y |brb| por ejemplo.  En general^ los adolescentes confiaran en su telefono mas estos dias porqué se puson comfortable en tratando sus situaciones entre los telefonos. Los adultos están más acostumbrados para tratar situaciones en persona con otros. </p><p>Un ejemplo en mi pasado que refleja las diferencias en comunicación que yo ha identificado fue una vez yo experiencie una amiga dejando su relación por telefono. Típicamente los adultos saben a gestionar estos tipos de situaciones en una diferente manera. Anque los adolescentes están más acostumbradas a tener los telefonos ellos tambíen les resulta fácil afrontar sus problemas allí. Esa amiga podría dejar su relación en otra manera como confrontar su novio en persona^ pero ellos aprovechan los telefonos mas de los adultos. Además^ yo pienso que los adultos están mas comfortables y acostumbrados a tratar situaciones así con mas madurez y de una manera más seria.

En el tren amtrack teine camas^ regaderas^ comida^aire acondicionado y calefacion y asentos requlinables. Si teines mucho denero te sugiro ir al amtrak si no no vayas. El amtrak cuestas mucho dinero para solo mente un espeaciso para una persona. Imaginate si venias en um grupo. Ahora con el tren regulas si vas a vajar a un lugar bein lejos los trenes no trabajan por la noche y si te jega a ser el noche y no ties lugar para domir te quedas en la caye. La bueno de usar el tren es que para copra el metro card para usar el tren. Depedendo a donde vas no custa mucho el metro card para cada ves que pasas la tarjeta questa 2.75$. Si no pudes  ejercicio ir al tren caminas una buena cantidad. Un otro transporte es por barco. En barco es como un mini vacacion tiene paradas y depedendo donde estas puedes nardar en el agua. La malo de ir a agua es que si vas lejos  se tarda para jegar.

207,SEASONS,<p>Hola ^ from early november to march the season is winter and is the coldest season of the year which usually comes with snow and other frozen rainy weathers . From april to mid/late june the season is spring which in my opinion is the best season because it isnt too hot but it isnt too cold as well. It is the perfect weather for every outdoor sport i would say and shows the true beauty of the enviornment. From mid/late june to august the season is summer which is the hottest and most outgoing season because alot of people usually travel and are at the beach and other activities to help them deal with the heat. Then^ there is fall which is the shortest season which starts from septermeber to early november and fall is the season where the trees leaves fall off and get ready for the winter chill.</p>,A1,3746445,26,P4786047,Your penpal lives in Mexico.
