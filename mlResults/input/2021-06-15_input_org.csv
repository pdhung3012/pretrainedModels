ANIMALS,"<p>I do not own a pet so  cannot give any solid reason as to which pet you should get but i do hear alot of goods things about dogs so maybe get a dog and heres why. A dog is a loyal and lovable companion who will be there for you when times get tough. Dogs can also help you with everyday tasks. With a dog around you know you have                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           some sort of protection in case of an attacker. Dogs can also elp you with work such as a police dog. Though dogs are great and all here are soke downsides of having a dog- your dog could roll themselves in the mud and walk around la casa like that^ they can also ruin household items if not trained properly. Dogs can be extremely rowdy and uncontrolable at times.

SEASONS,"<p>¿Hola^ cómo estás? Soy yo^ tu amigo. ¿Planeas venir a Corea el próximo mes? Bueno. Te contaré todo sobre el clima aquí. Corea tiene todos los estaciones^ primavera^ verano^ otoño y invierno. En primavera^ hace mucho sol^ y hace flores muy fantásticos. En verano^ también hace mucho sol^ en verano puedes comer helado y surfear en las playas. Corea tiene muchas playas porque el 75% de la costa es una playa; pero en verano^ lloviendo mucho. Hay muchos arboles rojos y amarillos y siempre hay muchas hojas en el suelo. Es un otoño muy tipicamente de el mundo. En invierna^ no hace sol^ pero nieva mucho. Entonces me gusta jugar con la nieve con mis amigos y familia. ¡Qué tengas un buen dia!</p><p>-Aivh<br>   <br></p><p>               </p><style type=|text/css|> p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 26.0px 'Helvetica Neue'; color: #000000} </style><style type=|text/css|> p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 26.0px 'Helvetica Neue'; color: #000000} </style><style type=|text/css|> p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 26.0px 'Helvetica Neue'; color: #000000} </style>",A1,3680471,2,S4706319,"Your penpal lives in Mexico.

En mi opinión^ un mayoría de los adultos usan más modos de comunicaion que pueden permitir a los adultos para oir su voz o ver su cara.
