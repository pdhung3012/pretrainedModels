CITY_TOWN,"<p>Hi Teacher^</p><p> I know your not from Baltimore and i heard your going to be out here for a couple days so i figured i can share a few intresting places I suggest you go while your here...</p><p>If you like sea food and things of that nature i think you should go to some sort of crab shack or sea food resturant because there is this thing  called a boil bag and you can get all the sea food you could imagne in one bag with falvorful sauce in the bag keeping it steamy and hot. Another place you could check out is Six flags if you like roller coasters^ thats a really fun experience. We Also have a graffeti alley where you can take nice pictures but that really all you do there. Lastly before you leave i think you should check out the harbor/a board walk its calming and relaxing but also fun. Theres lots of things to do theres resturants little games that you can play along as you walk i just think thats a cute fun expeience. I hope you enjoy your stay and check outsome of thethings i mentioned.<br></p><p>sincerly : Bri</p>",A1,3718899,27,F4749239,"A teacher from Guadalajara will be visiting your school.
