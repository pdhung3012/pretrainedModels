COMMUNICATIONS,"<p>Necesitamos comunicar con otras personas para ser feliz. Hay muchas modas diferentes de comunicar y en muchos casos son diferentes para personas con edades diferentes. La forma de comunicar más simple para todos es hablar. Con technología más advancada^ es muy fácil comunicar con personas en todo el mundo. Cuándo mis padres y abuelos eran jóvenes^ no fueron tantos opciónes para comunicar con amigos en otros lugares. Muchos niños comunican con el media social o escriben mensages electrónicos a sus amigos. Los correos electrónicos no son muy populáres con chicos ahora por qué los mensajes que enviamos usualmente son cortos. Muchos adultos usan los teléfonos para comunicar también. Ellos tienen más problemas con la technología por qué no existe por todas sus vidas. Muchos viejos no tienen cellulares por qué no pueden usarlos. Ellos hablan por teléfonos tradicionales. Algunas veces los chicos hablan por teléfono también. Los adultos se usan los correos electrónicos más que los chicos^ muchas veces para los trabajos. Cuándo chicos no tienen sus teléfonos^ es divertido escribir cartas a los amigos. </p><p>Yo fuí al campamente para todo el verano por seis años. El campamente está en el bosque y los chicos no tuvieron sus teléfonos por dos meses. Mi unica forma de comunicarse con amigos de escuela fue escribir cartas. Yo escribí una carta a mi amiga mejor todos los días y ella lo hice el mismo. Recibir cartas es cómo recibir regalos. Yo también escribir cartas a mi familia para decir que yo estaba bién y escuchar las historias de mi casa. Yo he hablado con dos de mis amigas todas las noches por más del año pasado. Ellas no viven muy cerca a mi^ pero gracias a la technología^ podemos hablar todos los días. Mi madre recibe cienes de correos electrónicos cada día. El mayor de estos son realados a su trabajo. Ella no les gusta los correos electrónicos. Mi abuela no puede enviar mensajes por teléfono cellular. A ella no le gusta mucha la technología nueva. Ella llama a nuestra casa y habla por teléfono con mi familia y yo por horas. Es muy interesante observar cómo la edad se afecta los tipos favoritos de comunicar. </p>",B2,3657164,11,B4680771,"In your Spanish&nbsp:class^ you have been discussing communication.

Necesitamos viajar ocho horas para ver a ellos entonces necesitamos mas tiempo para pasar visitando a ellos. Tambien en muchos familias en mi communidad es común ir a ceremonías religiosos en los domingos. Esté tiempo es importante porque es tiempo que pasas con tú familia que tiene mucho valor. En mi communidad de Vernon Hills muchos de mis amigos y otros estudiantes en mis clases tiene muchos actividades y por eso no pueden pasar mucho tiempo con sus familias. En mi generación tiempo es mas y mas dificíl a obtener. Tal vez cuando tienes tiempo libre es importante pasar con sus familias. Puedes comer cena^ ir a una ceremonía religiosa^ jugar un juego^ o ver una película. Cual quier cosa que haces es tiempo que es importante con tú familia. La familia de mi mejor amiga tiene una actividad cada lunes^ nadan en la piscina y despues comen hamburgesas y helado. Ella siempre dice que este tiempo es muy importante a ella y que siempre es su favorita cosa de la semana. La tiempo para la familia es muy importante y puedes hacer cual quier cosa que quieres. ¿Qúe actividades hacen con tú familia en España? <br></p><p>Atentamente^ </p><p>Brooke D </p>",B2,3654138,76,V4677241,"Your penpal from Spain wrote you an email.

Los estudiantes que no juegan un deporte pueden ponerse ropa muy moderna. Un tipo de zapatos muy populares son los |vans.| Son zapatos para andar en patineta. Se ponen camisetas de muchos colores^ desde negro hasta rosado. Afuera de la escuela^ en los meses de frio^ los estudiantes se ponen chaquetas hechas por la compañia North Face. Son muy modernas y tienen muchos colores. Mi favorita son las chaqutas negras de North Face. En mi communidad^ nadie juzga a la ropa de los otros estudiantes.</p><p>Hay muchos lugares adonde la gente sale a pasar tiempo juntos despues de la escuela. Al frente de mi colegio hay un parque muy grande llamado Fort Greene. Allí los estudiantes salen a jugar deportes o hacer la tarea con amigos. Otro lugar es un mercado llamado Dekalb. Allí la gente sale a comprar comida y sentarse con sus amigos y amigas para hacer tarea o para conversar. Una vez^ yo fui a el mercado Dekalb con todos mis amigos y amigas. En la mañana tomamos un examen muy imporante. Despues^ para relajarnos del examen^ fuimos al mercado para comer comida y pasar tiempo juntos. ¡Estaba muy frio!

COMMUNICATIONS,"<p>Necesitamos comunicar con otras personas para ser feliz. Hay muchas modas diferentes de comunicar y en muchos casos son diferentes para personas con edades diferentes. La forma de comunicar más simple para todos es hablar. Con technología más advancada^ es muy fácil comunicar con personas en todo el mundo. Cuándo mis padres y abuelos eran jóvenes^ no fueron tantos opciónes para comunicar con amigos en otros lugares. Muchos niños comunican con el media social o escriben mensages electrónicos a sus amigos. Los correos electrónicos no son muy populáres con chicos ahora por qué los mensajes que enviamos usualmente son cortos. Muchos adultos usan los teléfonos para comunicar también. Ellos tienen más problemas con la technología por qué no existe por todas sus vidas. Muchos viejos no tienen cellulares por qué no pueden usarlos. Ellos hablan por teléfonos tradicionales. Algunas veces los chicos hablan por teléfono también. Los adultos se usan los correos electrónicos más que los chicos^ muchas veces para los trabajos. Cuándo chicos no tienen sus teléfonos^ es divertido escribir cartas a los amigos. </p><p>Yo fuí al campamente para todo el verano por seis años. El campamente está en el bosque y los chicos no tuvieron sus teléfonos por dos meses. Mi unica forma de comunicarse con amigos de escuela fue escribir cartas. Yo escribí una carta a mi amiga mejor todos los días y ella lo hice el mismo. Recibir cartas es cómo recibir regalos. Yo también escribir cartas a mi familia para decir que yo estaba bién y escuchar las historias de mi casa. Yo he hablado con dos de mis amigas todas las noches por más del año pasado. Ellas no viven muy cerca a mi^ pero gracias a la technología^ podemos hablar todos los días. Mi madre recibe cienes de correos electrónicos cada día. El mayor de estos son realados a su trabajo. Ella no les gusta los correos electrónicos. Mi abuela no puede enviar mensajes por teléfono cellular. A ella no le gusta mucha la technología nueva. Ella llama a nuestra casa y habla por teléfono con mi familia y yo por horas.

COMMUNICATIONS,"<p>Las modas en que los adultos y los jovenes comunican en muchas maneras que son similares. Los dos usan la tecnologia un montón para comunicar. Las modas mas comunes son el teléfono y mandando mensajes por las redes sociales. Correo electronico tambien sirve^ pero por el mayor parte solo lo usa las personas que son un poco mas viejo y en situaciones de trabajo. La gran diferencia entre como los adultos y las jovenes comunican es en la manera que actúan y hablan. Adultos ya son plantado firmamente en como hablan y en muchos casos son más responsables que los jovenes. Los jovenes se comportan un poco diferente. Como no han tenido tanto tiempo y tantas interacciones con otra gente en sus vidas^ los jovenes todavia son creciendo un montón socialmente.

CLUBS,"<p>Señora M^<br></p><p>Cuando un estudiante viene a esta escuela^ tienen alrededor de catorce o quince años^ que es la edad perfecta de buscar un trabajo^ si necesitan o si quieren hacerlo. Para muchos estudiantes^ el processo de buscar un trabajo es demásiado difícil cuando no tienen ayuda.

También^ es una buena manera de conectar a la communidad. Si un negocio está buscando a personas para trabajar^ el club contectaría la persona a un estudiante que necesita un trabajo. El club puede dar a estudiantes la experiencia que necesitan para empezar trabajando^ y puede prepararles para la vida en la universidad. Podríamos tener una feria de trabajos cada año^ cerca del primer día de escuela^ para aumentar el interés en el club. Negocios locales pueden ir a la feria de trabajos y promover sus negicios o buscar a estudiantes para trabajar.

COMMUNICATIONS,"<p>Para empezar hay muchos differencias en las maneras de como los jovenes y los adultos communican. Los adultos normalmente son más educados y tienen trabajos por eso ellos son más professionales. Los jovenes normalmente queiren ser popúlar y hablan en las maneras que vean en los redes sociales. Los adultos normalmente hablan en oraciónes completas donde los jovenes hablan en maneras cortas y fragmentas. Tambien con los adultos ellos communican más con el telé. En vez de los jovenes que usan los redes sociales. Los adultos son más formal y los jovenes son muy informal. Estés differencias affectan como los adultos y jovenes communican. Por ejemplo^ los adultos usen el telé para communicar con un amigo casí un vez cada semana y hablan por un hora. Pero los jovenes usen los redes sociales para communicar con un amigo casí cada día y hablan por un minuto. Estés son las differencias más grandes porque los adultos usen su tiempo y tienen conversaciónes que tienen más valor y los jovenes tienen conversaciónes que son más rapido y de menos valor. </p><p>Para un ejemplo del pasado^ los adultos no tenían teléfonos antes de fueron 20 y los jovenes ahora tenían teléfonos cuando nacieron. Esté differencia tenía un impacto grande porque los jovenes tenían más experiencía con los teléfonos y los redes sociales. Los adultos no tenían los teléfonos para un mayoridad de su vida y ahora si usan pero no necesitan como los jovenes. Los adultos tambien a veces tiene los redes sociales pero tambien porque no tenían cuando eran jovenes no son muy importante a los adultos tener los redes sociales. Esté ejemplo cambio las maneras de communicación y impacto a los jovenes para ser más dependente en los teléphones y los redes sociales en vez de los adultos que vivieron sin los teléfonos y no necesitan y saben otras maneras de communicar y ser presente en las vidas de sus amigos. Esté cambio resulto en communicación más corto y más informal para los jovenes. Nuca vivieron sin la tecnología y ahora nucna van a poner la tecnología al lado para communicar porque muchos de los jovenes son tan admirados con sus teléfonos. </p><p><br></p>",B2,3654138,76,V4677241,"In your Spanish&nbsp:class^ you have been discussing communication.

Tambien visito a mi tia y paso tiempo con mis primos ellos son como si fueran mis hermanos^ me llevan a pasiar y comer la pasamos bien. Tengo una criatura muy especial y es mi perrita chiwawa se llama Candy me la dejo mi papa antes de partir me aseguro de pasar el tiempo que pueda con ella y ojala logre poder traerla conmigo.

FAMILY,"<p>¡Hola amiga!</p><p>¿Como estás? ¡Yo estoy emocionado que tú quieras aprender más de la vida de familia en Los Estados Unidos! </p><p>Aquí^ tenemos una cultura individualista. Hay un poco más espacio entre miembros de la familia en comparición de otros países que tienen culturas colectivistas^ como tu país España.  Valoramos privacidad mucho en los Estados Unidos y generalmente individuos viven en familias pequeñas con sus hermanos^ padres^ y mascotas solamente. Sin embargo^ en otros países es normal para la familia extendida vivir en la misma hogar. Por ejemplo^ mi amiga hispana vive con sus tío^ abuelos^ y bisabuelos en adición de su familia nuclear. </p><p>En los Estados Unidos^ pasamos tiempo con nuestras familias en muchas maneras. Primero^ mi familia y yo caminamos juntos cada día con nuestro perrito. Es muy común^ también^ para mirar películas^ cocinar^ y ir de compras con tu familia. En mi pueblo^ cada verano familias usualmente viajan a otros países. El caribe en particular es un lugar donde muchos familias en mi pueblo ir de vacaciones. Allá^ muchas personas se divierten con sus familias nadando^ comiendo^ y caminando. ¡Que divertido! Adicionalmente^ mi familia y yo somos de India y cada verano nosotros visitamos relativos en India. Para a mí^ estes viajes han sido súper interesantes y también han desarollado mi identidad mucho. Cada vez que vamos a India^ mi familia y yo viajamos a nuestro pueblo aboriginal. Mis bisabuelos nos enseñan sobre las historias de mis antepasados y nuestra manera de vida tradicional. ¡Estas experiencias con mi familia continuan a cambiar mi vida! También^ barbacoas son muy popular en los Estados Unidos^ particularmente durante del día de independencia. Juntos^ familias tienen reuniones donde todos los miembros de la familia cocinan^ beben^ y celebran la independencia de nuestro país. </p><p><span style=|font-size: 1em:|>Pero^ pienso que para muchas familias sea difícil de pasar tiempo juntos. Necesitas entender que para muchas personas pobres o trabajadores es difícil de pasar tiempo con sus familias. Para tener la oportunidad de pasar tiempo con su familia es una privilegia^ y para muchos individuos^ como madres sin esposos^ es difícil de encontrar tiempo para descansar cuando ellos están trabajando mucho. Como un resultado^ es difícil de hacer una generalización de la vida de familia porque las experiencias que familias tienen son diferentes dependiendo de sus situaciones. Por ejemplo^ las experiencias que el jefe de un negocio tiene con su familia son diferentes de un obrero que está trabajando en McDonalds. En mi familia^ por ejemplo^ mis padres trabajan mucho para proveer a mi hermano y yo^ y no pasamos mucho tiempo juntos porque de sus horarios hécticos. </span><span style=|font-size: 1em:|><br></span></p><p><span style=|font-size: 1em:|>¡Ojalá que tenga un buen día! ¡Ciao y gracias! </span><span style=|font-size: 1em:|><br></span></p>",B2,3739650,11392,S4773132,"Your penpal from Spain wrote you an email.

Si no puedes pasar el examen^ puedes ir al colegio de tu bario. Unas ventajas de los colegios especializados es que tienen muchos cursos de nivel de universidad^ tienen profesores de alta calidad y tienen muchos recursos para los estudiantes. Unas desventajas de los colegios especializados es que estan muy lejos de la mayoria de los estudiantes^ tienen mucho estre^ y son muy grandes. Los colegios de bario estan mas cerca y son mas pequeños pero no tienen acceso a los mismos recursos. </p><p>Hay varias opciones que los estudiantes tienen para despues del colegio. Muchos estudiantes deciden continuar su educación y aplicar a las universidades de mi cuidad. Algunas son la Universidad de Nueva York^ Columbia^ y la Universidad de la Cuidad de Nueva York. Otros estudiantes deciden salir de la cuidad y aplicar a universidades de otros estados. Algunos ejemplos de estas universdiades son Harvard^ Yale^ y Brown. Otra opcion para los estudiantes son escuelas tecnicas donde pueden aprender una habilidad especializada. Tambien^ algunos estudiantes sigen directamente a trabajar en lugares como restaurantes^ factorias^ y oficinas. </p><p>Espero que mi correo electronico respondio a todas sus preguntas. </p><p>Atentamente^</p><p>Marco Andrade<br></p>",B2,3744054,43,X4780390,"The students in your partner school in Madrid want to learn more about students and education in your community.In two well-developed^ organized paragraphs^ write an email in which you address the following:	Describe the different types of schools and education options that are available in your community.

El club organizaría eventos dónde los participantes pueden trabajar juntos para asistir estes lugares. Además^ este horario compartiría a las noticias de la escuela también. En este modo^ los estudiantes no necesitan ser en el club para saber sobre los eventos. Generalmente^ este club crearía las oportunidades para muchos estudiantes dónde aprenden los valores importantes.

Es un proceso muy facil^ y casi igual a como es en Costa Rica. Primero^ vas a tener que ir a la biblioteca para sacar una tarjeta de biblioteca. Para poder sacar la tarjeta^ debes llevar una prueba de direccion y una tarjeta de identidad. Como eres una estudiante extranjera^ podras llevar el pasaporte como prueba de identidad. Puedes pedirle a tu familia de intercambio la prueba de direccion. </p><p>Despues^ tendras que entrar a la biblioteca y buscar un libro que te parece interesante. Cuando tengas el libro^ puedes continuar al mostrador para sacar los libros. Cuando estes allí^ puedes darle tu tarjeta de biblioteca a la bibliotecaria or el bibliotecario. El o ella te dira cuando tienes que devolver el libro y te dara un recibo. ¡Eso es todo! <br></p><p>Mucha suerte cuando vallas a la biblioteca. ¡Bienvenida a Nueva York!</p><p>Atentamente^</p><p>Marco Andrade</p>",B2,3744054,43,X4780390,"You are emailing an exchange student from Costa Rica who is new to your school.

Cuando encuentras los libros que quieres leer^ hay un lugar en el centro de la biblioteca con una señora que tiene una computadora. Tienes que darle los libros que has elegido y ella va pedir tu número de identificación de estudiante. Después ella va regresar los libros y vas tener dos semanas para leerlos. Si no has terminado de leer los libros^ puedes regresar a la biblioteca y te pueden dar dos más semanas para terminar de leer los libros. Cuando terminas de leer los libros hay una canasta en la biblioteca donde puedes regresar los libros. </p><p>La bibliotecas afuera de la escuela son casi iguales. Lo único diferencia es que te dejan prestar más libros y tienes más tiempo para leerlos. También tienes que tener un trajeta de la biblioteca^ pero el proceso para agarrar la tarjeta es muy fácil.

La personas que hicieron Melody Farms quiería tener murales que pueden inspirar a otros. Un dato interesante es que los murales fueron pintado por estudiantes en la secundaria de Vernon Hills. Una de mis amigas fue eligido para pintar en los paredes públicos.  En una pared hay una mural de mariposas que tiene las palabras: Puedes volar alta si quieres. Estes palabras para alguien puede ser solamente palabras para una persona pero para otra persona puede ser algo que inspira. Para mi cuando yo vio a este mural para la primer vez no pensé mucho porque solamente fue arte en mis ojos. Pero cuando yo vio el mural la segundad vez pensé que fue motivición para completar el resto del año en la secundaria añtes de la universidad. Esté mural sirve para differentes personas por differentes razónes en nuestro communidad. Por eso es el arte más bonito y recongnizado en mi communidad. Yo supo que para mi mama esté mural tiene no significa pero para mi hermana lo ayudo cuando ella fue enferma porque inspiro continuar y ser fuerte. Murales son muy bonitos pero mi arte favorita es el arte abstracto. El arte abstracto es mi arte favorita porque es interpretiva. Yo puedo recordar a una clase que yo tenía en la primaria donde nosotros vimos mucho trabjo de Pablo Piccaso. El fue un aritisa del arte abstracto. El tenía una pintura que yo penso que era un mono pero mi amiga penso que era un tigre. Esté es la cosa bonita del arte abstracto porque tú puedes ver que tú quieres y que tú piensas que es.

ART,"<p>¡Hola!</p><p> El arte de mi ciudad es muy diverso y distinto. Yo vivo en Massachusetts^ y este estado tiene una historia rica y ha desarollado como un resultado de la mixtura de muchas culturas. Primero^ los indígenas que vivían aquí originalmente ha contribuido a las formas locales de arte mucho. Acerca de la biblioteca en mi pueblo^ existe una |iglesia india| que los conquistadores de Inglaterra establecieron en el año 1677. Por muchos años^ indígenas rezaban allá y esta iglesia es distinto porque tiene caracteristicas indigenas y ingleses. En el interior de la iglesia^ hay pinturas por artistas indígenas que representan escenas de sus vidas tradicionales. Además^ en el centro del pueblo hay muchas pinturas por artistas hispanas. Después de la guerra mundial^ muchos inmigrantes hispanos vinieron aquí y también trajeron sus formas de arte. ¡Los murales en el centro del pueblo demuestran el efecto inmigración ha tenido en nuestra comunidad! Estes murales son muy simbólicos y representan la resilicencia de los hispanos que ha sobrevivido a pesar de racismo y odio. También^ nuestra escuela secundaria es otro lugar que tiene mucho arte. Cada año^ el club de jabón usa papel para crear estructaturas de |origami|.  Estas cosas de origami están en frente de la oficina y son muy intricados. </p><p>Personalmente^ yo prefiero pintar con acuarelas. En mi opinión es más fácil de pintar con acuarelas en comparición de otras maneras de pintar^ como con acrylícos. Pinturas de acuarelas son muy bellas también. Por ejemplo^ Claude Monet^ un pintador muy famoso^ usaba acuarelas muchas veces para crear pinturas que continuan ser reconocidos por la gente. </p>",B2,3739650,11392,S4773132,"Your Spanish teacher asked you to write a post for your class blog about local art for exchange students coming to your town from Madrid.Write a blog entry in which you explain where you can see art in your town or school and what kind of art you prefer and why.

Más personas están solicitando admisión a las universidades y aunque muchos estudiantes de nuestra escuela son candidatos perfectos (han recibido buenos notas en sus clases y son trabajadores)^  universidades ahora requieren servicio comunitario para la admisión. Muchos estudiantes hacen falta de esto pero ¡podemos arreglar esta problem con la formación del club del servicio comunitario! Formar un club de servicio comunitario sería muy beneficioso para muchos estudiantes que buscan ingresar a universidades competitivas.

Finalmente^ mejorar las experiencias de estudiantes en nuestra escuela es un gol grande que el club tendrá. Como resultado^ ¡nosotros planearamos una fiesta para la escuela! Por este evento^ ¡estudiantes pueden interactuar con nuevas personas y hacer nuevos amigos también!

Espero que tú no tengas tanta tarea allí. También^ es dificil hacer la tarea porque tengo actividades despúes de la escuela. ¿Que haces tú despúes de las días de escuela? ¿Haces deportes^ música^ o otras activiades extracurricular? Sé que probablemente es diferente allí^ porque las vidas español y estadounidense son muy diferentes. Por diferente que sean^ estoy seguro de que hay similaridades^ probablemente con la tarea. ¡Todos los maestros en el mundo le encanta a la tarea! Si fuera maestra^ no dé demasiada tarea a mis estudiantes. Son suficiente estresados y cansados. Es una otra pregunta que tengo: ¿a qué hora te despiertas cada mañana? Mi escuela empieza a las siete y media^ y me levanto a las seis y media. Probablemente es diferente aquí de allí. Pues^ espero que me escribas pronto.

ART,"<p>¡Hola^ blog! En mi communidad de Vernon Hills hay muchos murales en nuestro pueblo. Sí quieres ver el arte necesistas ir a Melody Farms. La personas que hicieron Melody Farms quiería tener murales que pueden inspirar a otros. Un dato interesante es que los murales fueron pintado por estudiantes en la secundaria de Vernon Hills. Una de mis amigas fue eligido para pintar en los paredes públicos.  En una pared hay una mural de mariposas que tiene las palabras: Puedes volar alta si quieres. Estes palabras para alguien puede ser solamente palabras para una persona pero para otra persona puede ser algo que inspira. Para mi cuando yo vio a este mural para la primer vez no pensé mucho porque solamente fue arte en mis ojos. Pero cuando yo vio el mural la segundad vez pensé que fue motivición para completar el resto del año en la secundaria añtes de la universidad. Esté mural sirve para differentes personas por differentes razónes en nuestro communidad. Por eso es el arte más bonito y recongnizado en mi communidad. Yo supo que para mi mama esté mural tiene no significa pero para mi hermana lo ayudo cuando ella fue enferma porque inspiro continuar y ser fuerte. Murales son muy bonitos pero mi arte favorita es el arte abstracto. El arte abstracto es mi arte favorita porque es interpretiva. Yo puedo recordar a una clase que yo tenía en la primaria donde nosotros vimos mucho trabjo de Pablo Piccaso. El fue un aritisa del arte abstracto. El tenía una pintura que yo penso que era un mono pero mi amiga penso que era un tigre. Esté es la cosa bonita del arte abstracto porque tú puedes ver que tú quieres y que tú piensas que es. Tambien el arte abstracto es el arte mas uníco y interesante en mi opinon. Nunca vas a ver dos pinturas del arte abstracto que miran el mismo. Yo quiero saber a tus favoritas tipos de arte. Pone tus respuestas abajo para que puedo ver que te gusta. Gracias por leer^ Brooke. </p>",B2,3654138,76,V4677241,"Your Spanish teacher asked you to write a post for your class blog about local art for exchange students coming to your town from Madrid.Write a blog entry in which you explain where you can see art in your town or school and what kind of art you prefer and why.

COMMUNICATIONS,"<p>Primero^ en comparación los adultos^ muchos niños usan las redes sociales para comunicarse.

En realidad^ muchos niños no sienten la necesidad de comunicarse en persona y^ en general^ les gustan^ comunicarse con otros a través de Internet. Sin embargo^ muchas personas mayores todavía prefieren hablar por teléfono y me he dado cuenta que muchos adultos dan prioridad a comunicarse e interactuar con otras personas en persona.

Hoy^ en gran parte como resultado de las redes sociales^ muchas frases^ palabras^ y acrónimos se han vuelto muy popular entre los jóvenes. Usamos palabras como |lol| y |gtg| con mucha frecuencia.

COMMUNICATIONS,"<p>La comunicación es necesario por la humanidad. Una cosa que nos separa de los otros animales es las maneras y idiomas que usamos para comunicar. Las maneras han cambiado con la humanidad y tecnología. Acutalmente^ los niños usan la tecnología para comunicar más que hablar en persona. Los niños textean y hablan por teléfono mucho^ y los adultos no lo hacen tanto. Los adultos prefieren hablar en persona^ en reúniones o días afuera. No les gusta mucho textear o hablar por teléfono. Ambos tienen avantajes y desafíos. La tecnología es bueno para comunicar cuando está en casa. Si no puede ir afuera^ podrá textear sus amigos o familiares. También^ si necesita algo rapidamente^ puede hablar con alguíen en linea. Pero^ hay desvantajes también. Hay confuso cuando personas dicen algo en mensajes en linea. Hablar en persona es mejor en este manera. Hablar en persona es la manera en que las personas pueden hablar y mirar expresiones. Por importante que sea las expresiones^ también hay desafíos cuando necesita quedar en casa. </p><p>Un ejemplo de las avantajes y desvantajes occuré hace dos semanas. Mis amigas y yo estabamos texteando porque necesitabamos quedar en casa para las clases. Era bueno que no tuvieramos salir de casa para comunicar.

En mi ciudad puedo ver lo en los edificos^ pues sea adentro o afuera. Para el arte en mi ciudad prefiero el arte abstracto. Puede añadir mucho color a una lugar muy negra y oscura.

Es demasiado color para la escuela. Entonces es sufficiente color para los edificos y ciudad^ pero para la escuela es demasiado. Pienso que el arte perfecto para la escuela sea el arte realistico. Porque si puede tener color pero normalmente no va a ser los colores muy briallentes.

COMMUNICATIONS,"<p>Las modas en que los adultos y los jovenes comunican en muchas maneras que son similares. Los dos usan la tecnologia un montón para comunicar. Las modas mas comunes son el teléfono y mandando mensajes por las redes sociales. Correo electronico tambien sirve^ pero por el mayor parte solo lo usa las personas que son un poco mas viejo y en situaciones de trabajo. La gran diferencia entre como los adultos y las jovenes comunican es en la manera que actúan y hablan. Adultos ya son plantado firmamente en como hablan y en muchos casos son más responsables que los jovenes. Los jovenes se comportan un poco diferente. Como no han tenido tanto tiempo y tantas interacciones con otra gente en sus vidas^ los jovenes todavia son creciendo un montón socialmente. Tambien creen nuevas palabras a dan nuevas definiciones a palabras viejas para que tienen una lengua mas divertida para usar. Otra cosa que afecta la manera en que los adultos y los jovenes comunican es que^ en muchos casos^ no preocupan sobre las mismas cosas. Los adultos tienen que preocupar sobre su profesion y como van a pagar para la luz^ la agua^ su carro^ etc.^ mientras que los jovenes van a estar preocupado sobre la escuela^ aprendiendo sobre quien ellos son y quien quieren ser^ como escoger y encontrar amigos^ y tal vez cosas extracurriculares como deportes y clubs.</p><p><br></p><p>Por ejemplo de adultos no sabiendo lo que significa las cosas que jovenes han añado a la idioa ^ yo he escuchado un montón de cuentos sobre las padres usando frases como LOL o los emojis en maneras que no significan lo que creen. He visto una conversacion por mensaje entre alguien y su abuela despues del muerte de su mascota. Su abuela le mando un mensaje que decía |I'm sorry to hear you dog died LOL|. Uno de las amigas de la abuela había dicho de LOL significa |Lots Of Love| aunque de verdad es |Laughing Out Loud|.</p>",B2,3744010,70,Q4780281,"In your Spanish&nbsp:class^ you have been discussing communication.

FAMILY,"<p>Estimada Amiga: </p><p>¡Gracias por su correo electrónico! Yo estoy emocionada para tener la oppertunidad de responder a sus preguntas. Para mi familia en los estados unidos es muy importante que nosotros tenemos tiempo para pasar juntos. En mi familia un tiempo importante es la cena. En mi casa^ nosotros comemos cena cada dÍa juntos. A veces es dificÍl porque nosotros tenemos differentes actividades durante el dÍa pero mi mamá siempre puede encontrar un tiempo que nosotros podemos hacer. Tambien en mi familia es muy importante pasar tiempo con mis abuelos. En mi situación mis abuelos viven en differents estados y es mas dificíl a ver ellos. Necesitamos viajar ocho horas para ver a ellos entonces necesitamos mas tiempo para pasar visitando a ellos. Tambien en muchos familias en mi communidad es común ir a ceremonías religiosos en los domingos. Esté tiempo es importante porque es tiempo que pasas con tú familia que tiene mucho valor. En mi communidad de Vernon Hills muchos de mis amigos y otros estudiantes en mis clases tiene muchos actividades y por eso no pueden pasar mucho tiempo con sus familias. En mi generación tiempo es mas y mas dificíl a obtener. Tal vez cuando tienes tiempo libre es importante pasar con sus familias. Puedes comer cena^ ir a una ceremonía religiosa^ jugar un juego^ o ver una película. Cual quier cosa que haces es tiempo que es importante con tú familia. La familia de mi mejor amiga tiene una actividad cada lunes^ nadan en la piscina y despues comen hamburgesas y helado. Ella siempre dice que este tiempo es muy importante a ella y que siempre es su favorita cosa de la semana.

COMMUNICATIONS,"<p>Para empezar hay muchos differencias en las maneras de como los jovenes y los adultos communican. Los adultos normalmente son más educados y tienen trabajos por eso ellos son más professionales. Los jovenes normalmente queiren ser popúlar y hablan en las maneras que vean en los redes sociales. Los adultos normalmente hablan en oraciónes completas donde los jovenes hablan en maneras cortas y fragmentas. Tambien con los adultos ellos communican más con el telé. En vez de los jovenes que usan los redes sociales. Los adultos son más formal y los jovenes son muy informal. Estés differencias affectan como los adultos y jovenes communican. Por ejemplo^ los adultos usen el telé para communicar con un amigo casí un vez cada semana y hablan por un hora. Pero los jovenes usen los redes sociales para communicar con un amigo casí cada día y hablan por un minuto. Estés son las differencias más grandes porque los adultos usen su tiempo y tienen conversaciónes que tienen más valor y los jovenes tienen conversaciónes que son más rapido y de menos valor. </p><p>Para un ejemplo del pasado^ los adultos no tenían teléfonos antes de fueron 20 y los jovenes ahora tenían teléfonos cuando nacieron. Esté differencia tenía un impacto grande porque los jovenes tenían más experiencía con los teléfonos y los redes sociales. Los adultos no tenían los teléfonos para un mayoridad de su vida y ahora si usan pero no necesitan como los jovenes. Los adultos tambien a veces tiene los redes sociales pero tambien porque no tenían cuando eran jovenes no son muy importante a los adultos tener los redes sociales. Esté ejemplo cambio las maneras de communicación y impacto a los jovenes para ser más dependente en los teléphones y los redes sociales en vez de los adultos que vivieron sin los teléfonos y no necesitan y saben otras maneras de communicar y ser presente en las vidas de sus amigos. Esté cambio resulto en communicación más corto y más informal para los jovenes.

COMMUNICATIONS,"<p>Para empezar hay muchos differencias en las maneras de como los jovenes y los adultos communican. Los adultos normalmente son más educados y tienen trabajos por eso ellos son más professionales. Los jovenes normalmente queiren ser popúlar y hablan en las maneras que vean en los redes sociales. Los adultos normalmente hablan en oraciónes completas donde los jovenes hablan en maneras cortas y fragmentas. Tambien con los adultos ellos communican más con el telé. En vez de los jovenes que usan los redes sociales. Los adultos son más formal y los jovenes son muy informal. Estés differencias affectan como los adultos y jovenes communican. Por ejemplo^ los adultos usen el telé para communicar con un amigo casí un vez cada semana y hablan por un hora. Pero los jovenes usen los redes sociales para communicar con un amigo casí cada día y hablan por un minuto. Estés son las differencias más grandes porque los adultos usen su tiempo y tienen conversaciónes que tienen más valor y los jovenes tienen conversaciónes que son más rapido y de menos valor. </p><p>Para un ejemplo del pasado^ los adultos no tenían teléfonos antes de fueron 20 y los jovenes ahora tenían teléfonos cuando nacieron. Esté differencia tenía un impacto grande porque los jovenes tenían más experiencía con los teléfonos y los redes sociales. Los adultos no tenían los teléfonos para un mayoridad de su vida y ahora si usan pero no necesitan como los jovenes. Los adultos tambien a veces tiene los redes sociales pero tambien porque no tenían cuando eran jovenes no son muy importante a los adultos tener los redes sociales. Esté ejemplo cambio las maneras de communicación y impacto a los jovenes para ser más dependente en los teléphones y los redes sociales en vez de los adultos que vivieron sin los teléfonos y no necesitan y saben otras maneras de communicar y ser presente en las vidas de sus amigos. Esté cambio resulto en communicación más corto y más informal para los jovenes. Nuca vivieron sin la tecnología y ahora nucna van a poner la tecnología al lado para communicar porque muchos de los jovenes son tan admirados con sus teléfonos. </p><p><br></p>",B2,3654138,76,V4677241,"In your Spanish&nbsp:class^ you have been discussing communication.

ART,"<p>¡Hola^ blog! En mi communidad de Vernon Hills hay muchos murales en nuestro pueblo. Sí quieres ver el arte necesistas ir a Melody Farms. La personas que hicieron Melody Farms quiería tener murales que pueden inspirar a otros. Un dato interesante es que los murales fueron pintado por estudiantes en la secundaria de Vernon Hills. Una de mis amigas fue eligido para pintar en los paredes públicos.  En una pared hay una mural de mariposas que tiene las palabras: Puedes volar alta si quieres. Estes palabras para alguien puede ser solamente palabras para una persona pero para otra persona puede ser algo que inspira. Para mi cuando yo vio a este mural para la primer vez no pensé mucho porque solamente fue arte en mis ojos. Pero cuando yo vio el mural la segundad vez pensé que fue motivición para completar el resto del año en la secundaria añtes de la universidad. Esté mural sirve para differentes personas por differentes razónes en nuestro communidad. Por eso es el arte más bonito y recongnizado en mi communidad. Yo supo que para mi mama esté mural tiene no significa pero para mi hermana lo ayudo cuando ella fue enferma porque inspiro continuar y ser fuerte. Murales son muy bonitos pero mi arte favorita es el arte abstracto. El arte abstracto es mi arte favorita porque es interpretiva. Yo puedo recordar a una clase que yo tenía en la primaria donde nosotros vimos mucho trabjo de Pablo Piccaso. El fue un aritisa del arte abstracto. El tenía una pintura que yo penso que era un mono pero mi amiga penso que era un tigre. Esté es la cosa bonita del arte abstracto porque tú puedes ver que tú quieres y que tú piensas que es. Tambien el arte abstracto es el arte mas uníco y interesante en mi opinon. Nunca vas a ver dos pinturas del arte abstracto que miran el mismo. Yo quiero saber a tus favoritas tipos de arte.
